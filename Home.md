# Welcome to the `twitter-backend` developer wiki!
This is an incubating project undertaken by [@ohbus](https://github.com/ohbus), inspired by [@championswimmer](https://github.com/championswimmer)'s discussion from [here](https://twitter.com/championswimmer/status/1403193048360652800)

Application is intended to be developed parallelly to [this](https://github.com/scaleracademy/open-source-projects/discussions/81) discussion by [Scaler](https://discord.gg/8x9vUbMCJb)

## Summary
A twitter-like social media site where
- anyone can post 240-character texts.
- people can reply, like, or reshare the posts.
- Users can follow each other.
- The home feed shows posts from users that they follow.
- Users will be notified when someone likes their posts, replies, or reshares them and when someone follows them.
- Users and posts can be searched.

## Future Scope
- Shifting to a microservices-based architecture
- OAuth2 based login and connection
- Email notifications service
- Report posts
- User's can send personal messages to each other 
- Allow accounts to be private (only visible to followers) 
- Turn on notifications for a particular user 
- Bookmarking posts 
- Topics 
- Filtering keywords on hateful and abusive texts, eventually leading to permanent blocking
- Trending Section with certain hashtags and topics based on tweets
- Add caching support using Redis
- _( Feel free to add your own wishlist, the Wikis are publicly editable )_

Please note that these scopes are mainly meant to be a part of the user's perspective.

We will be defining similar development scopes as you know of JIRA epics which will be collated issues.
